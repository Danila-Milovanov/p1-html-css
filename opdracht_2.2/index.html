    <h1>HTML Fundamentals

    </h1>

    <h2>What is HTML?

    </h2>

    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>

    <h2>What are HTML Elements?

    </h2>

    <p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be displayed.</p>

    <h2>What is a tag?

    </h2>

    <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>

    <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?

    </h2>

    <p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended the data to appear on the screen.</p>

    <h2>What are the basic HTML Elements?

    </h2>

    <p>The elements we learned about were <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;</code>.</p>

    <h2>More Elements</h2>

    <h3>The &lt;a&gt; Tag

    </h3>

    <p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (“anchor”) element allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other areas within our own web page). You will always see the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element used with the <code>href</code> attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</p>

    <h3>The &lt;img&gt; Tag

    </h3>
    
    <p>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an <code>src</code> attribute which points to the address of the image to be displayed. Note: <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags can be self-closing as they do not need two tags. Simply put the <code>/</code> before the closing bracket in the first tag.</p>
